# TU Graz Data Visualization Design System

## Our project

We're creating a system that helps visualize data in a way that matches TU Graz's look and feel. Think of it like a toolkit that makes sure all our charts and graphs look consistent and professional.

All of these follow TU Graz's design rules!
